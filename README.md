Certainly! This is a simple calculator program that is built using the Tkinter library in Python. The program is designed to add or subtract two numbers that the user inputs through two text boxes.

When the user clicks on the "Add" button, the program adds the two numbers together and displays the result on the window using a label. Similarly, when the user clicks on the "Subtract" button, the program subtracts the second number from the first number and displays the result.

The program consists of a main window that is created using the Tk() function. The window is titled "Simple Calculator". The program uses Label and Entry widgets to create two text boxes for the user to enter the numbers.

There are two buttons labeled "Add" and "Subtract" that the user can click to perform the corresponding operations. When the user clicks on either of the buttons, the program executes the respective function, which retrieves the values entered in the two text boxes, performs the calculation, and displays the result using a Label widget.

Finally, the program enters a mainloop() which keeps the window open until the user closes it.
